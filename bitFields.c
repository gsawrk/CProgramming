/* 
 * 1-bit signed field on a two's complement machine can only take the values 0 or -1.
 * Bit fields do not have addressesâ€”you can't have pointers to them or arrays of them.
 * The unsigned definition is important - ensures that no bits are used as a  flag
 * Some bit field members are stored left to right others are stored right to left in memory
 * always explicitly mark 1-bit bit fields as unsigned
 * 
 * **************************************************************************************
 * http://www.9wy.net/onlinebook/CPrimerPlus5/ch15lev1sec4.html :
make sure the value doesn't exceed the capacity of the field.
What if the total number of bits you declare exceeds the size of an unsigned int? 
* Then the next unsigned int storage location is used. A single field is not allowed to overlap the boundary between two unsigned ints. The compiler automatically shifts an overlapping field definition so that the field is aligned with the unsigned int boundary. When this occurs, it leaves an unnamed hole in the first unsigned int.
You can "pad" a field structure with unnamed holes by using unnamed field widths. 
* Using an unnamed field width of 0 forces the next field to align with the next integer:
struct {
    unsigned int field1 : 1;
    unsigned int        : 2;
    unsigned int field2 : 1;
    unsigned int        : 0;
    unsigned int field3 : 1;
} stuff;

Here, there is a 2-bit gap between stuff.field1 and stuff.field2, and stuff.field3 is stored in the next int.
